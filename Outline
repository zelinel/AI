I don't like that github is making me pay to have my data private. Can I do this elsewhere? Or should I just pay?

Purpose
A replica of a human brain. After teaching it to read, I want it to be able to scan textbooks, internet, etc to learn as humans do. I want it to read scientific papers for me and summarize them. For example, google scholars is shitty. If I ask it to make me a database of the wavefunctions of various type 2 superconductors and organize them by material category and critical temperature, it should be able to do so and detect a trend as wolfram alpha does.

Components
1. Teach it grammar. Teach it how to create new concepts.
2. Download a dictionary.
3. Test run it by making it scan documents to organize and update grandmother cells.
4. Make it scan programming books so it becomes a program that can program. It should be able to scan grammar books and program itself to adjust for changes in grammar over time. 
5. Make it scan math books to create wolfram alpha like results. Edit the program so that it learns to create new data by connecting various grandmother cells.

        c <- connectODBC "DSN=PSPDSN"
        xs<- getTables c
        putStr $ "tables "++(foldr jn "." xs)++"\n"
    where jn a b = a++" "++b

Is it always the case that phrase1(#phrase2)?

ex) Zelda is yellow.

    #ethnicity(#yellow, #white, #blue, #red, #brown, #black, #etc)
ex) Yellow Zelda wants black tea.

    #tea(#black, #jasmine, #oolong, #etc)
ex) Count from 1 to 10.
    V Preposition N Preposition N
    V(Preposition(N)Preposition(N))    <--Starts with V, therefore a command.-->
    encounter new law: N Preposition N
ex) Image: Yellow Submarine
    submarine(#yellow, #beatles)
    yellow(#color, #wavelength(BLANK to BLANK nm))
    beatles(#band, #discography(#yellowsubmarine, #iamthewalrus))

I should distinguish between examples and definitions.
Alternative hashtag suggestions?
#definition
@example

Webcrawl for fuller definition of everything.

For cases where a word has multiple wordclasses
ex) green(#noun(#color), #adjective(#color))
    The color is green.
    Article N V N
    The green grass is wet.
    Article ADJ N V ADJ
the meaning may not necessarily differ but the wordclass matters indetermining sentence structure.
Sometimes it matters.
ex) bug(#noun(#lifeform), #verb(#bother, # disturb))
    The bug is dead.
    Article N V ADJ
    'bug' is surrounded by N and ADJ, so it must be a V to be grammatically correct.
    I bugged my brother
    N V Pronoun N
    'bug' is surrounded by N and Pronoun, so it must be a N to be grammatically correct.
    The bug bugged me.
    Article N V N
    The first 'bug' is after an Article, so it must be a N.
    The second 'bug is succeeded by a N, so it must be a V.



After basic grammar and vocabulary is programmed, the program must next learn to acquire more information and program itself.
Grandmother cell generation is straightforward and the same laws may be applied.
Further programming of grammar rules:

Sequence Recognition
if NV
    then statement
elif VN
    then command
elif V
    then command
elif ? or fluctuation goes up towards end of sentence
    then question

ex) Write me a program in python that lets me play rock paper scissors.
    V B B N B V B V N N N
    Wikipedia Definition: Rock-paper-scissors is a hand game usually played by two people, where players simultaneously form one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. The "rock" beats scissors, the "scissors" beat paper and the "paper" beats rock; if both players throw the same shape, the game is tied.
    NNN V
    rockpaperscissors(#handgame)
    implied that hand is used to make shape. Not specific enough in the text.
    Visual recordings of rockpaperscissors may create a more complete definition.
    rock > scissor > paper > rock
    if symbol1 = symbol2 then tie

Statistics vs Connections
Connecting cell A to B. Options:
1. A X B
2. A Y Z B
Shortest way is A X B.

Statistics:
Count associations of AB, AX, AY, AZ, AC, etc and the cell with highest count association with A is most likely.
ex) AB 10, AX 2, AY 4, AZ 1, AC 8. AB is highest use therefore it must be AB.
But is this the same thing as connections because the more counts there are, the more hashtag connections are likely to be made?
